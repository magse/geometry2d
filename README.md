# geometry2d

A c++ template library for 2D geometry operations.

The templates are mostly of general character and include c++ classes like vec2, line2 and circle2. However, the library was initiated with the purpose of supporting special opening mathematical area functions found in fluid power valves and their sometimes delicate internal geometries.

The library is more focused towards accuracy than speed. It supports and is tested for the three main floating point types: **float**, **double** and **long double**.

It is licensed according to the LICENSE file.
